# Thoughts, Questions, & Ideas

## General QA Questions

* As I am onboarding/new, is there a live version of the tool I can take a look at for comparison's sake?
* What browsers are supported? What browsers do our end users typically use (analytics/mks)? What about OS versions, mobile devices (and viewports)?
* What are your biggest priorities and concerns, Product Owner?
* Who is our target end user/target audience? Who is this being built for?
* Are there any design docs, stories, or comps available for comparison?

## Requirements Questions

* Should the tool ignore case, numbers, spaces, special characters, etc?
* Are we required to reach a certain level of Accessibility? (Screen readers, tabbing, contrast, etc.)
* Are there any specific requirements around the performance/response time of the tool?
