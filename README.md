# palindrome-tasks

The thoughts/notes/"solutions" to two palindrome-related tasks.

## Task 1
* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/dyL4daju/) (Open your browser console and press Run)

Develop a palindrome validator using your language of choice that will take in a list of strings and determine whether they are a palindrome or not. For the purposes of this exercise, a palindrome is defined as a string which reads the same backward as forward â€“ ignoring case and non-letters.

### Key Points

* Input is a list of strings
* Output is whether each string is a palindrome or not
* Case should be ignored
* Non-letters (numbers, spaces, special characters) should be ignored
* A palindrome is defined as a string which reads the same backward as forward

## Task 2
